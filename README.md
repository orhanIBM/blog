  Gatsby's blog starter
</h1>

Kick off your project with this blog boilerplate. This starter ships with the main Gatsby configuration files you might need to get up and running blazing fast with the blazing fast app generator for React.

_Have another more specific idea? You may want to check out our vibrant collection of [official and community-created starters](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/gatsby-starters/)._

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Start developing.**

    Clone the master branch for development. 
    
    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd my-blog-starter/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby Tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-4/#use-graphiql-to-explore-the-data-layer-and-write-graphql-queries)._

    To add a new blog post, just create a new folder under /content/blog; preferably the folder name should represent the title but it doesn't have to. Add an index.md and you are good to go.

    To see markdown examples, checkout the template folder.

    To change blog layout, edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## ðŸ’« Deploy

    Just run `npm run deploy`.
    Sit back and relax, the changes will be sent to orhanibm.github.io/blog
